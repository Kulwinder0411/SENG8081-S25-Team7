# Project Topic:
How student sleep patterns and lifestyle affect academic performance.


# Description:
The project aims to analyze the sleep habits of university students and how it affects their daily lives. 
Aside sleep patterns, the data also takes into account lifestyle choices like screen time, exercise, and study hours, and how these activities may affect their sleep. 
Our goal is to find patterns that show how these factors are connected.

# Sleep Patterns And Lifestyle Affect Academic Performance

# Data Research Process: 
The principal aim of our project is to evaluate the connection between the hours of sleep, sleep quality, and other daily activities included in the student schedule: screen time, hours studying, and physical activity.
In order to determine appropriate datasets, we utilized search service such as college sleep behavior, student sleeping patterns, and sleep and academic performance on Google Dataset Search, Kaggle, GitHub, and RPubs. Having evaluated a few sources, we chose three sets of data that are close to our study objectives:
- ## Student Sleep Patterns (Kaggle, by Arsalan Jamal):
The data has a good structure and the variables present in the data are the hours of sleep, quality of sleep, the time spent using screens, stress, study time, and physical activity. It was best suited to conduct statistical and visual analysis to determine some patterns of student sleeping behavior.
- ## Insomnia of students and college performance (Mendeley):
This is a collection of the survey data of 985 students that covers information regarding the frequency of insomnia, their GPA, stress, and characteristics of their lifestyle. It offers great insights concerning the effect of sleep disorders on education.

- ## RPubs Sleep Study Dataset:
This dataset contains structured variables of sleep in a clean form, which is appropriate in regression, correlation analyses, and visualizations.

Collectively these datasets will enable us to ask questions like:

- Is there a linkage between more screen time and poorer sleep?

- What is the effect of physical exercise on the length of sleep?

- Does academic performance have anything to do with sleeping habits?

Through these trends, we would like to emphasize the significance of sleep as the key to student well-being and academic results.

# Description of Dataset 
This dataset contains information on studentsâ€™ sleep duration, quality of sleep, screen time, physical activity, and overall health, among other factors. Each row represents a student, with columns which include their age, gender, university year, sleep duration and timing (weekday and weekend start and end times), study hours, screen time, caffeine intake, physical activity levels, and self-reported sleep quality
It includes a manageable number of records and is available in a clean CSV format.  It has consistent data types, making it easy to load and process using Python libraries like pandas or visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI.
